,"Horrible service... after 20 minutes at the table we had to ask the hostess where our waiter was.  Then we watched all the employees stand around and try and pass us off on each other.  Eventually the ""unluckiest"" came to our table to get us started.  He brought the four items we ordered to the table separately and brought the beer that one person ordered last.  Waiter came back to give us the check without asking if we wanted anything else.  Another beer was ordered, which seemed to be an imposition since the check was already ready.  At the end, he gave us his name and asked us to come back.  I think not....","Where do I start lol so my boyfriend and I just wanted to come in to get some good food and margaritas. We barely got that. So we got sat outside in the corner no big deal. First our table was dirty and it took about 20-30 minutes for that to get cleaned. Our server never came and after being stared at by a nearby server who finally said ""Oh! Has no one came to you guys yet"" that's when we kinda got some service. She took our drink orders..this isn't our server by the way and eventually our actual server, Margaux finally came to our table with waters. Again still dirty table. Again it took 20 minutes for her to even come to our table. 

I got the peach margarita and it was unbelievably sweet. I like sweet drinks but that was a bit much for me. So she took our food order and we didn't see her again for like 30 minutes. The food was ok nothing to get excited about. But we wanted to get another margarita and just chill but it took her so long to come back to our table, we just didn't want to be there anymore. We had been here before and got similar service soooo yeah, definitely over this place and not coming back. Sucks though because margaritas are pretty cheap.","Like Lauren B. said, this was a horrible decision based on the weather, lack of other places nearby to walk to, and hunger. The hostess forgot about us/forgot to give us a beeper so we lost our first table. The waitress didn't come for about 10 minutes because we had drinks already and thought we were being taken care of. We didn't have knives on the table, but had 2 forks each.

My fries came out cold, they forgot a person's side order, messed up another person's order, and seemed like this was their first day. Scary thing was, though, that our waitress was training someone else who came up to us after the dessert and coffee were served (and still on our table) and she started to give us another table's dinner order.

I am not going back."
,"I called due to a ad on a website provided by Westgate saying that Disney tickets were being sold for $59 called and was told to make a reservation for tour and that could get three Disney Epcot and three universal ... but would need to pay 565.00. ... so we paid rep Caroline ... we started getting calls for the next three days asking to verify income, marital status and card details ... gave same info each time ... 4th day was finally sick of calls and went off on Caroline's supervisor Linda ... she said she didn't get a completed call of verification ... so I again verified my info ... she then stated that there was a question of my marital status because they had traced my phone number and saw where a call was placed back three months earlier saying the Person was married travailing without their spouse and if they could still do the tour for a hotel stay ... I explained that my mother had called about a hotel stay she had seen on her work site at Westgate and that she had a different middle initial then my own but we had the same first name as it was a family name ... she said oh that's okay and confirmed everything and sent us an email confirmation for our tour ... fast forward to being on vacation in Florida at Westgate Lakes tour date ...sign in ad end up sitting there for 39 min while everyone who came in after us headed out for tour ... finally their manager Jessica calls me over and says she can't give us the tour because of descrepency with marriage status ... I'm like what !!!!! I already went over this with Westgate corporate manager Linda and she said it was fine and I was okay to come ...Jessica proceeds to tell me the tour wasnt happening and I wasn't getting my tickets ... I then Say I want my money then and she days yeah u can have ur money in 5-10 business days ... so I really get upset ... when they took the money out it wasn't in five-ten business days and we needed the money to go buy legit tickets ... she was all cold and saying I'm sorry we can't help u ... u can call corporate was all she would say ...so of course I call and they've are closed for another two hours ... I'm really mad now ... we gave up $560 and was lied to my their corporate office with them saying we were clear on verification and got up at the butt crack of dawn to drive an hour to Westgate lakes to be denied our money and our tickets .... so Jessica the manager st the location then tells us we can sit and wait for corporate but she knew the answe would still be no... after waiting two hours and trying to search online for my divorce paperwork ...I call corporate they say they can't refund my money for 5-10 days ... and no tour can be given ...I tell them if the inconvenience we went through after being lied to by their corporate manager Linda ... and they still don't do anything .. I escalate again and get another manager who tells me u can pay the difference of the $560 of $221 and pay for yeh full price of the tickets which by the way cost more then the tickets are at the gate .. and taking the lesser of the two evils we pay the extra because we don't want to get screwed out of money we needed for vacation and paid the fee ...so I tell the lady to stay on the phone until we get the tickets from Jessica ... she tells me on the phone to go to the counter and ask for Jessica ... I go up and say can I speak with Jessica the manager ... and the lady behind the desk says 'yes, please and thank you' and she stands and walks off ... where do these horrible customer service reps get their nerve ... who in their right mind would get a time Share with these idiots ... so I'm still on the phone  and I tell the manger on the phone 'did u hear that, she was completely rude and for what... that wa smh first time speaking to her'... the phone manager asks me to get her name as she's building a file ... so I ask the lady at the counter who had been sitting next to her and .. she says I can't say it's a different department ... and she clams up ... i tell the phone manager they they refused to give names and she goes on to say that she will get details during the investigation and so u finally get Jessica back and ask her the names and she says she can't say because her Custer agents are from a different department .... the phone manager then says she can't really say what's happened as she can only make out a little info as she's having phone sound difficulty ... what a joke !!!!!!.... these reps really know how to lie and cheat they're way out of anything and have the worst customer service and people skills ever !!!... if they are like this on a tour ... imagine having them as a time share location ...... run !!!!!...... they take no accountability for their own actions and basically lie and scheme to take money off the unexpected !...I'm the end I got my tickets and they too were the wrong ones to the wrong park .... lawsuit and bank dispute in their future from me!","I never leave bad reviews but this one is post worthy.

3 days before our teams trip to Orlando I called and spoke to a young lady who took the time (over 10minutes)to accept my reservation of 30 people (15 kids 15 adults) the young lady said she could accommodate us outside and specifically said they had heating lamps in case it was cold. She took my name and phone number and said to call an hour before to confirm. GREAT! 

Fast forward I called 2 hours ahead of time on the day of reservation  to confirm  and spoke with a young lady who said she had no information on us and they don't take reservations. I then asked to speak to her manager. 

Her manager gets on the phone immediately with an attitude as though I'm bothering her. She says whoever we spoke to should never have said she could accommodate us. I explained to the manager that i had 30 people who would be hungry for dinner at 730 after a long day of competition and what was I to do. Her response? Sir I can't help you is there anything else? SERIOUSLY? Yes!

I told her that I will be contacting corporate. 

I've owned restaurants and would never speak to anyone in such a way. I then received a phone call back a half an hour later by the same girl, and I saved the message because I will be contacting corporate, she still sounded annoyed and said due to the incompetence of our staff please call us back to see how we can rectify this situation.

Needless to say I never called back and 30 of us gave our business elsewhere.","We live about 20 minutes away from this restaurant but had been given a $15 gift certificate from Restaurant.com that we wanted to use, it had just been purchased 3 days prior. We decided to give it a shot.  The food was pretty good, comparable to many other mexican restaurants though.  The service was SLOW.  We were in the section by the bar so our server was also playing bartender, bad idea.  As the bar filled up our service became even slower.

When it came time to check out I handed the server our $15 gift certificate.  He immediately shook his head and said ""We no longer accept those.""  I explained that it had just been purchased 3 days prior on October 10, 2016.  After we discussed the validity of the certificate, he said he would get the manager, obviously not the server's issue.  The manager came over and immediately shook his head.  He denied ever doing business with restaurant.com.  Mind you, this goes completely against what the server told us.  The server said that they stopped accepting them which means they did at one time.  The manager denied this and basically told me we were out of luck.  I explained that the sole purpose of even coming here to try this place out was the incentive of the gift certificate.  In fact we had ordered more food then we normally would to satisfy the requirements of the gift certificate, further inflating our bill.  He didn't care.  He said the certificate was no good and told me I needed to contact restaurant.com.  First of all, that is incorrect.I think the restaurant needs to contact them and see why they are selling gift certificates with the restaurant's name.

He was rude, arrogant and dismissive.  It completely ruined out entire dinner.  It's not about a measly $15.00.  Its about being in the service industry and accommodating your customers.  I suggested they put it up in the window to warn other customers who may have the certificate.  He said, ""Yea we did that for a couple weeks but took it down.""  When I asked to have the owner's first name so I could contact them to discuss he refused to give it to me.  HE REFUSED TO GIVE ME THE OWNER'S FIRST NAME. Then I asked his name and he said ""Mike""  LOL, this guy's name was not Mike. The whole thing was so crazy I thought there may be a hidden camera. I looked at a couple that was overhearing the whole thing and they were shaking there heads and laughing at how ridiculous this ""manager"" was.  I told him that I would be reviewing this experience on multiple sites and he said he didn't care.  I said ""Over $15??""  He said ""do whatever you want.""  LMAO  $15 is money well spent so I know to never go here again and let everyone I know to never go here again.

What a joke!!!  Do not go to this restaurant.  There are several other options in the area that are better.  There is nothing more I can't stand then basic customer service.  This isn't about the customer always being right, this is about basic customer service.  Do me a solid and go somewhere else.  I left my name and number and asked to have the owner call me.  I will happily take down these reviews if they offer to make this right."
,"Roscoe's is your middle-of-the-road bar located in Montavilla. It's neither upscale nor a dive bar, just a comfy dark pub to enjoy good beer, bar food and pool. The tap selection is pretty spectacular and the service is spot-on. I also like that when you start a tab at the bar, they swipe your card and then give it back to you to avoid someone throwing back a few too many walking out without their card and leaving the bar with an unfinished tab. 

This should be a solid 4 star review. However, the experience I recently had when 4 friends and I decided to grab a late-night beer on a quiet Sunday night drops this review down to two stars. On this night, there was another regular patron who was straight up frightening. He was obviously loaded, and not a very nice drunk; playing all the metal music available on the jukebox, throwing his pool cue down like a two-year-old having a temper tantrum, and standing on bar stools over the bar while pulling his pants down around his ankles (thank god he wasn't going commando!) 

The main reason we ended up chugging our beers and high-tailing it out of there is that the bartenders did nothing to quiet, cut-off or kick out this unruly dude. We couldn't quite tell if the bartenders were friends with the guy, or afraid of what might happen if they did try to curb his behavior. I can't imagine being a bartender, bouncer, babysitter and OLCC enforcer all at the same time is an easy feat, but someone really should have stepped in and taken control of the situation. Not many people like a side of crazy with their beer.","We went here on a Saturday night when they had an 80s themed DJ.  They were obviously not used to the crowd of people as they had the chef at the bar making drinks too.  For some reason, they had the seating area closed past the bar and it was so crowded I heard several people leave.  The bartender we got was half pouring drinks, they were very weak and he couldn't find a lime for the drink and said they were out although another bartender was cutting one up shortly after.  So, I thought it was overpriced with bad service, but they were definitely overwhelmed that night.","I have been here for drinks several times and never had an issue. 

I was there yesterday afternoon and had a terrible experience. I will not be returning anytime soon. 

The bartender dropped my friends drink on the bar and it completely shattered and spilt all over her. Then, I was drinking my beer and there was a bug swimming around in it. I didn't notice at first because it was such a dark beer. It was absolutely disgusting, and the staff didn't even apologize once I informed them. 

I will not be back. And, if you don't want bugs in your drinks, then I wouldn't recommend this bar."
,"The service was good but they forgot several items off of the burgers we ordered. My guest and I left feeling quite unsatisfied. We sat at the bar and ordered one well done burger and one medium burger and FB fries. 3 stars on my ordered toppings. Carmelized onions were burnt, didn't ask how I wanted my egg cooked so instead of over medium which is what I assumed they would make, I got one that was well, well done. Feta cheese was sliding off into a drippy mess. I don't mind messy burgers but messy burgers gotta be good. This one didn't make the cut. 3 stars on FB fries. Just okay which is sad because they should be better based on the mixture of ingredients.

What a really great burger needs more than an amazing bun and fresh toppings? A great burger! The meat. The patty. Its gotta be flavorful, juicy, seasoned correctly. This burger was dry. Even the medium burger was dry. My toppings couldn't even enhance the taste. If I had to guess I'd say the lack of seasoning was the issue. I've had really great burgers from specialty burger joints. This place has all the makings to be a great specialty burger place except an actual great burger. 

I did order the chicken pot pie fritters on the snack menu and those were tasty. You get 3 for the for $4. If I ever returned, I'd only order that.","It was an unfortunately unpleasant experience. While we had dined at Flip Burger establishments in the past and enjoyed ourselves, tonight's excursion was lackluster.
We arrived as walk in guests after catching a movie at the Plaza and were promptly seated. There was confusion over who was responsible for our table and though we placed our orders with one server, two others approached us over time to see whether or not we had ordered. We ordered one shake and three burgers, with modifications only to one (no condiments please). The burgers took an exceptionally long time (30 minutes). When the burgers arrived, the de-condimented burger was loaded with condiments, and the second burger didn't have any of the advertised condiments.
And the shake only arrived after re-requesting it when the burger arrived.

The food tasted fine. My chorizo burger was great, but the complications to the burgers was frustrating.

As a server myself, I often find myself bending over backwards to keep my customers happy. Tonight we were disappointed by our service and food and got little else than a shoulder shrug from our servers. There are tons of other burger places In the city - I'll be sure to try them out before returning to Flip.","Really rather disappointing, got a burger and fries for takeaway, almost 16 dollars.

burger was meh, fries average. i've tired the burger at the main spot as well, to me very overrated. if i want an overpriced burger i'd go to shake shack, if i wanted a truly great burger i'd make my own, weird every place in town wants to rip off this style."
,"I love Greek food and have eaten at many Greek restaurants in Atlanta and New York.  Since I live less than 1.5 miles from this relatively new restaurant, I decided to finally give it a try.  The initial reviews on various sites for this restaurant were not great when they first opened a couple of months ago, but I felt it was time to have ironed out any issues with the food.  Unfortunately, the food was not worth a return trip.  

Although the staff was very friendly and provided good service, it could not make up for the overall experience.  As a small side complaint , the decor of the restaurant was a bit over the top on the tacky side with lots of neon and seemed very cold with too much echo because the walls are covered in various marble tiles and cut glass mirrors.  It reminds me of some of the over-the-top diners in Long Island.  The decor and lighting was a bit distracting during the meal, and the lighting was definitely too bright for an evening dinner.  This is not the place for an intimate or romantic dinner.  It would be great for a large group, I suppose, especially if you are into watching TV from almost every angle while you eat.

Starting out with appetizers for 2, we spent $19...ordered a spanakopita (7.95) and their combination plate of dips (10.95).  The spanakopita, which has always been a favorite of mine, was not good at all and was far too greasy with not enough dough for the copious amount of spinach.  The flavor was very bland and tasted like they skimped on ingredients or either it was just a pre-made frozen dish.  I have had better spanakopita from the grocery store freezer if that tells you how disappointing this dish was...especially since most Greek restaurants do a good job with this popular dish.  

The combination of dips was mediocre, but I did really like the spicy feta cheese dip.  Out of the ice-cream-scoop-sized selections, it was the only one that I can say was really tasty.  Their Taramousalata was just as bland as what you would find at the grocery store in a jar and did not taste at all like it was made on the premises.  Furthermore, I would consider their pita bread to be slightly below average in taste and texture for a Greek restaurant.  It was not any better than what you would find at the local grocery store full of preservatives. 

For dinner, we chose wraps (7.95-8.95).  The problem with both wraps was they were OVERLOADED to the point of frustration with lettuce and TONS of onion.  I love onion, but I had to take apart the wrap to remove a giant handful... and more and more shredded onion kept coming out!  it was just too much!  There was also WAY too much lettuce.  This restaurant does what many others do...which is load up the wraps and sandwiches with the cheaper stuff like lettuce, sauce and onion and skimp on the tomato, feta, olives, meat, etc.  We removed half of the lettuce and half of the onion which brought the wrap down to a normal and manageable size to eat.  However, that left us with very little else in the wrap since the meat, feta, etc was in such small quantity.  This is definitely a case where bigger was not better.  My sister said the flavor of her gyro meat was good, though.  

Perhaps my biggest surprise was how terrible the fries and Greek potatoes were.  The fries had a burned oil flavor...they were extremely hard, overcooked, and may well be the worst french fries I have ever eaten aside from when I accidentally burn the frozen kind in the oven at home.  The Greek potatoes were definitely better than the fries, but tasted like they had been sitting around for a while.  The texture of oven roasted potatoes should be soft but not mushy, sticky and wet.  The lemony flavor was pretty good, but they just didn't taste fresh at all...the taste was more akin to ""microwaved leftovers"" since they were overcooked and reheated.

The sweet tea was good and I drank lots of it.  And we would have gotten dessert since we love Greek pastries, but felt it would be a disappointment after everything else failed to meet our basic expectations.  Perhaps their other dishes are wonderful, but it is hard for me to trust a kitchen that doesn't bother to put any pride in the french fries or roasted potatoes they serve since they accompany almost every dish.  I felt the kitchen skimped on ingredients and did not produce dishes that made full use of all the wonderful seasonings you find with most Greek and Mediterranean restaurants.  In my opinion, this is more like the ""Waffle House"" of Greek restaurants...bright, loud and cheesy atmosphere with food that you shouldn't expect to be chef quality.","Recently moved from Vancouver to New WEst and we're on the hunt for a good pho spot. Came here on a sat for dinner and place was occupied by 2 other tables. Ordered #14 house special  pho, cold cut sandwich and spring rolls. We ordered the sandwich udner reccommendation from others. 
Sandwich: served on ciabatta likely from costco, large pieces of cucumber, pickled veggies, pate and some slices of pork roll. Disappointed they didn't put any cilantro. Overall the sandwich was nothing great, something anyone could easily put together at home. I will stick with ordering banh mi from actual banh mi shops to avoid disappointment. 

PHo: Extremely disappointed. Soup was not hot enough. I was repulsed by the first taste of the soup, something which has never happened before. I grew up eating fish sauce because my mom was raised in Haiphong, Vietnam but this place uses too much fish sauce. The soup lacked depth and complexity in traditional pho  soup flavours. I felt like they didn't use a long cooking method or spices. I could barely taste any star anise or cinnamon -- just fish sauce!! Hubby and I had to use a lot of hot sauce to make it more palatable.  Some slices of meat didn't taste as fresh, particularly the tendon which had a strange very stale taste - likely been sitting in the fridge and exposed to circulating air for a long time. 

Spring rolls: Wrapped in egg roll wraps. Filling was mostly vermicelli wit minimal amounts of meat or vegetables. I noticed that many of the pho houses here in New West use a lot more vermicelli compared to pho houses in Vancouver where a lot more meat and vegetables are used. OIl was not fresh so rolls came out very dark in colour but at least they were still crispy. 

Overall, not impressed with food and don't plan on coming back or recommend to anyone.","Well, I read these great reviews on Yelp for this place and said, we've got to try this. 

My husband and I experienced nothing interesting or even especially good, though very expensive for lunch. We both had lunch items from the lunch vermicelli platters, I had grilled shrimp and he had steak. We agreed the actual shrimp and beef pieces were excellent, but everything with them was bland to the point of tasteless. 

The side sauces of a syrupy sweet sauce and red peppery sauce, I suppose, were supposed to help, but though nothing was what I would call ""bad,"" nothing was good or flavorful. And the menu said an egg roll was included, which turned out to be so small that at first I missed it - cut into two barely bite sized pieces buried inside the salad. Basically the main dish was a big bow of greens and plain, un-sauced noodles, for $12.50 each!  I could've like it with,say, an oyster sauce.  SOMETHING.

Also, we originally ordered glasses of Pinot Grigio, which were obviously oxidized upon smelling and tasting. The server willingly replaced these with Chardonnays, but a server who can't tell that an orange glass of white wine is obviously not good, not to mention the smell, well, that is unprofessional at an inexcusable level. 

We live in Titusville and can find far better options for $12+ a piece for lunch. Nah, I don't see what these good reviews are based on. Saw nothing worth returning for."
,I went to kfc and first off when i got to the window the girl dropped my money before giving it to me so instead of coming around and getting it or even taken some out the drawer she just looked at me and said oh sorry.. i had to get out of my car to get it. And it's was raining as well.. and once i got home i opened mg box and they forgot my cookie.. great! And the food just looks sad.,"They get 4 stars for the food being good, however they have yet to get an order correct, so they get 2. Will not be returning. Such a shame.","Food is getting really bad and the server...sucks, took 45 minutes just to get us the bill."
,Worst service. 25 minutes until someone came to get our drink order... And that's after we had to ask the host where our server was. 30 min later Half the food came out. Then we waited another 10 minutes for the other half. Waited another 30 minutes for dessert. Good thing we ordered it the same time as our meal. We were there for 2 hours and 15 minutes. And there were NO apologies from any of the staff for the ridiculous wait. At least most of the food was good.,"The food was decent, not worth the 20 minute wait, and then another HOUR wait for food.
Overrated, and a waste of time.","As a neighborhood resident who likes to support local restaurants and businesses, I was appalled at the customer service we, and numerous other patrons, received at Lucca last Friday afternoon.  We arrived at 2 p.m. and the male server was very curt and rude to us, saying that it would be at least a 10 minute wait as he rushed past us.  The restaurant was about 20% full when we arrived so a 10 minute wait seemed absurd.  During what turned out to be a 25 minute wait, not one server apologized for the wait, explained the reason for the wait during what was clearly a slow time, or even smiled/acknowledged us.  Also seated in the waiting area, an older gentleman who referred to himself as Bob told us he'd been waiting for almost 30 minutes for a take-out order of soup.  While we waited 25 minutes to be seated, the following occurred: a pregnant woman and her mom who had been waiting to be seated before we even arrived were finally seated and they said it took them 30 minutes to be seated, a table of three women told their female server that they had been waiting 15 minutes for a take-out box for their leftovers and for their check to which the server replied ""I'm sorry but you'll just have to continue to wait,"" a woman with her toddler and mother took their check to the bar to pay saying they'd been waiting for 20 minutes to pay their check, and Bob, the neighborhood resident waiting for soup asked the male server ""how much longer for my simple bowl of soup?  I've been waiting for a half an hour.""  To that, the male server loudly snapped, ""Man, I don't know! It'll be up when it's up!""  We were truly horrified as were the other patrons in the restaurant who all heard that conversation.  Then, about five minutes later, the female server brought him two to-go containers of soup and a bag with a roll in it, plopped them all down separately on the bench where Bob was waiting and said ""that'll be $10!!""  She was so rude to him and she didn't bring his to-go order in a bag - she brought it in three separate containers.  Bob had to ask for a carry-out bag.  Bob then told me that he's lived in this neighborhood for almost 40 years and he's seen this location change from one entity to the next and he has always tried to support the neighborhood, but with this type of customer service, he's not sure he can return to Lucca.  I then overheard the female server snap at another customer saying ""We're understaffed today.  You'll just have to wait!""  Being understaffed certainly presents a challenge but it's never an excuse to treat customers terribly.  In the past, my girlfriends and I have regularly chosen Lucca as the venue for our monthly GNO's (girls' night out) but after last week's experience, I will strongly reconsider ever suggesting we host GNO at Lucca again.  If the customer service doesn't match and/or exceed the quality of the food, Lucca is not a restaurant I'd like to support any further.  And, we didn't...we left and drove to Cha Cha Cha on Fremont where we received tremendous customer service, delicious food and yummy cocktails.  And as a result, we promptly posted photos and details of our lovely experience on Facebook, Twitter and Yelp."
,We've ordered twice in about a month. Both times they got our orders wrong. Yesterday's order was not only wrong but it took 1 hr 5 min and we're less than 5 min away. Not ordering from there again.,Everytime I order it takes about an hr and I order the same thing weekly subs are always soggy enough said will Not order again!,"Ordered delivery and the food came 30 minutes later than the time they said. It was cold and the order was also wrong. When I called them to complain, they basically told me I ordered it wrong. Wtf. The food is disgusting and I will never order there again.  What a disappointment and a waste of $20"
,bad service dont go here! They needs to learn customer service... They're food is okay but the service is extremely bad..... Im not going here again.... My mom was even disappointed because of their service...,"Worst service ever!!!!!!!!!! Just pray you don't sit with Bri, worst attitude I ever encountered from a server","I just went there tonight to have a nice dinner with my girlfriend and the whole dinner ended bad with the worst customer service ever from the manager. He had bad manners, lied to us about how the restaurant.com certificate works and everything else. The food used to be good but seems to be getting worse day by day. The only good thing there is the creme of mushrooms and that's it. The service is bad, waiters give you attitude and manager is the worse. Sorry Chef Vincent, lost a long time customer by bad customer service and getting worse food."
,"Ok we tried Mod pizza tonight for 1st time. We are disappointed. 11 inches for a pizza is small barely enough to feed 2 people and definitely not enough to feed a family. Breadsticks are as flat as cardboard. I mean we know pizza being from Chicago we know good pizza. Toppings were sparce. These pizzas were flatter then thin crust. I don't think we will be eating here again. 11 inch pizza is basically a serving for one person. I mean Papa Murphy's, and Via Chicago even Flying pie has bigger pizzas then Mod Pizza. Even pizza hut or dominos pizzas are bigger then Mod pizza.",Worst Dominos pizza experience I have ever had!!!!!!  I ordered my pizza at 11:19. At 1151 my pizza was out for delivery. I waited a whole hour for my pizza and once it arrived it was cold and I had to reheat my pizza!!!! I would not recommend this place to anyone!! I am encouraging everyone to find a different dominos! This one SUCKS!,"This place sucks from the food preparation,  to the oven they use. Pizza is just awful. You get better taste eating the pizza box.The Arby's of pizza."
,Foods alright but not for the price...the price was food poisoning! I've had to worst food poisoning for 3 days now!,"FOOD IS GOOD SERVICE IS POOR. Walked in and ordered food. 35 min later (and 12minutes past closing time) still no food. I ask about the food and employee asked what was ordered -_-  she then leaves returns with the food. No apology, no remorse, just hands the food over.",The place is really charming in the German Village. The food was so so.  Nothing on the menu was authentic German food.  I'm German and nothing would fly as German food back in Germany.  The taste and food quality was subpar.
,"Sorry to be a downer and go against the grain here but my experience at Santarpios in the space of a year has been less than thrilling. The first time I went the pizza was great, I loved it and raved about it to friends. We also got the sauasages and meat they bbq which was good. The second time I went it was ok, not as good as the first time. I thought maybe it's an off night. The third time I went with some friends who I had told it was really great. Well turns out it was awful!!! I don't know what happened. I was embarassed in front of my friends. I never went back. Santarpio's you're dead to me!!! Dead I tell you!  Pepe's all the way!!!","We have been to Roscoe's several times over the last year...It seems every time we go, they get worse!  
The beers are mostly IPA's or aged something or another...SOUR SUMMIT was this weekend and it sucked!  The prices get higher every time we go, too!???!
I have had the oyster Po'Boy many times and this time it left a huge GUT-BOMB in my belly!!  The bun was dry as all get out AND the sandwich barely had any slaw OR oysters!!!  It was a huge disappointment and I doubt we will be back!!!",Second time I got food poisoning from this place. It tasted great going down but the 4 times vomited last night was a horrible suprise I'm done.
,"This place used to be a cool, chill place. Now its a bunch of neanderthal bouncers hopped up on steroids acting like the can do whatever they want. There are so many better places in davis square where they are glad you are visiting their business. Sad that the burren is now the worst place in davis.","There's some really strange decor inside, like, murals and multipiece mirrors, sports decorations for Patriots, Celtics, Bruins, Red Sox and Revolution all in the same place, and a really out of place sign that reads ""Home of Generation X"" or something like that. What the hell? Feels like this place is still stuck in 1995.

I've only bought some chicken vegetable soup on one occasion and the falafel+hummus wrap on another. Both were mediocre for taste and quality. I guess you'll want to stick to their deserts, which is what people seem to like about this place.","I don't know what happened to this place, I think its going in decline. For starters the staff isn't really customer service oriented. Restrooms look detrimentally in need of attention. To be fair the food is edible (had the asadero enchiladas) but the rice (and my friend agreed) tasted horrible like plastic. Her chicken breast also tasted like it had been frozen. I don't mean to bash the place, but Im just disappointed that this place is supposed to be a genuine Mexican place and I feel bad that I've actually been referring people here when they ask of good Mexican food places to try, that changed today."
,"We went there for Taco Tuesday tonight . Not worth it at all 3 tacos for $3  maybe... but even at that they have no flavor not good your better off going to many others places for that price .  We asked.the waitress  what she recommended for Taco Tuesday or anything on the menu there she said she just started working and didn't know,  she did not explain the taco prices that they were all different just that we could Not order one of each. So they charged us $18 for 6 tacos on Taco Tuesday wtf . Tacos everywhere are only $1-$2  especially for average tacos on Taco Tuesday.  We only went in to try because we saw there sign advertise that they have homemade tacos , after eating there that is hard to believe. We talked  to another employee and our waitress  they pretty much defended themselves and ignored what we had to say  and charged us $18 for 6 not good tacos when we clearly told are waitress it was our first time there for Taco Tuesday and was there for the 3 for $3 and asked for recommendations she was so unhelpful and charged us for what she did not explain prices it's not like it was on the regular menu . NOT IMPRESSED.","I initially came here thinking it was a different Mexican place (meant to go to El Pelon Taqueria) and wanted fish tacos. The quality and freshness of the ingredients seemed to be pretty good but they gave me vegetable tacos when i ordered fish tacos. After I paid and complained, I don't think they understood me and just told me they did not have fish tacos. Would have been nice to know before they served me.

Bang for your buck, at $3 a taco I would have probably walked over to Chipotle or went a little farther to El Pelon Taqueria which has much better food IMHO.","2 people dinning his fish sandwich came to the table. I waited for my 2 tacos, 1 fish 1 jimichurri.  And waited. After he was 1/2 done my 2 tacos finally came. Fish taco was soggy and the stk taco dripped oil.  Not good won't be back."
,"This chicken is not all that. It's just lightly fried chicken. The sides are bland as well. Go to Lucy's fried chicken instead, that chicken and sides are the bomb!","Had the Southern Fried Chicken Salad. Wasnt very good. Menu says it has a chicken breast on it..
Ended up with just chopped chicken fingers. Very disappointing and menu is not accurate.",The chicken biryani was OK but the chicken tikka masala was horrible i won't come back again
